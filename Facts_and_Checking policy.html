        </p>
        <h2>1. Verification Process</h2>
        <p>
            Before publishing any information or content on BookHive, we conduct thorough fact-checking and verification procedures. This includes cross-referencing information from multiple credible sources and consulting subject matter experts when necessary.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Credibility Assessment</h2>
        <p>
            We prioritize information from reputable and authoritative sources. Content that lacks sufficient evidence or comes from unreliable sources is not published on our platform. Additionally, we clearly label opinion pieces and user-generated content to distinguish them from factual information.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Corrections and Retractions</h2>
        <p>
            Despite our best efforts, errors may occasionally occur. When inaccuracies are identified, we promptly correct or retract the erroneous content. Users are encouraged to report any misinformation or factual errors they encounter on our platform.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p>
            BookHive maintains editorial independence and does not allow external influences to compromise the accuracy or objectivity of our content. Advertisers and sponsors do not have control over the editorial decisions or content published on our platform.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Transparency</h2>
        <p>
            We are transparent about our fact-checking process and editorial standards. Users can access information about our editorial policies, verification methods, and sources cited through our website. We welcome feedback and strive to continuously improve our fact-checking practices.
